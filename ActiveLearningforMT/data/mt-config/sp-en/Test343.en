yes , my name is masters , timothy masters .
okay , mister masters . i see you have reserved a king and a double .
two rooms , is that correct ?
yes . the rooms are close together , right ?
let me take a look .
actually , i see that the king is number seven twenty six , but the double is on the fifth floor , number five oh six .
that won ' t do .
i am vacationing with my family and i would like us to be on the same floor .
i had assumed you would realize that if i booked two rooms under the same name , they should be close together .

i am very sorry , sir , let me see what i can do .

i ' m sorry , sir . i will get the manager . just a moment .
sir , i spoke with the manager and she has allowed me to offer you the room next to yours at the same price you would pay for the double .
i am sorry for the confusion .
let me get your keys ready .
that ' s the sort of service i would expect .
okay , here we are . two keys to each room .
these are for your room , number seven twenty six , and these two are for room seven twenty eight .
